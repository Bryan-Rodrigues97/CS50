Javascript Usage
I brought into the homepage the development done in the trivia problem set. On this page, I use JavaScript to verify answers. I attempted to use constants and events in JavaScript to create more generic functions.

Bootstrap Usage
I tried to use Bootstrap across all pages. Since my CSS skills are quite limited, I preferred to consult Bootstrap documentation for styling solutions.
